# scheduler


the following project was created to meet the follow standards:

-GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
-WHEN I open the planner
-THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
-WHEN I scroll down
-THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
-WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
-THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
-WHEN I click into a time block
-THEN I can enter an event
-WHEN I click the save button for that time block
-THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
-WHEN I refresh the page
-THEN the saved events persist

the project was created using multiple libraries such as jquery, bootstrap, and moment.js in an effort to simplify and condense the code as well as provide a proper layout with minimal hard coding necessity. Moment.js and jquery were used to allow proper color coding of time blocks as well as provide the current day. bootstrap was used for the layout.
